RAG_final: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation

Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generative AI models. The system enhances text generation by incorporating relevant external knowledge retrieved from a predefined dataset.

Features

Implements a retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant context for text generation.

Uses a transformer-based language model for generating responses.

Optimized for handling domain-specific queries with enhanced accuracy.

Jupyter Notebook (RAG_final.ipynb) provides step-by-step execution.

Installation

To run the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If a requirements.txt file is not available, install the essential libraries:

pip install transformers torch faiss-cpu sentence-transformers

Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook RAG_final.ipynb

Run the cells step by step to execute the retrieval and generation pipeline.

Modify the query input to test different retrieval and generation outputs.

Dependencies

Python 3.x

Hugging Face transformers

torch

faiss-cpu for efficient similarity search

sentence-transformers for embeddings
